# dfs-bfs-practice

The goal of this repo is to practice and experiment with graphs, types of searches, and how to manipulate the searches for different use cases.

## Recursive vs Iterative
This is an implementation of BFS and DFS using both recursion and iteration. The goal was to gain greater insight into the two different implementations and how they relate.
